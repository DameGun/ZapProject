# ZapProject
This is my 2nd year course project. I only started my path in developing and c# seemed to me kind of easy and nice language.
After i understand that coding some basic applications like winforms and a year of high mathematics, i decided to deep into web.
Of course i was a bit (a lot) stupid to start creating complex web applications, so after reading some info i chose MVC pattern.
While developing this "Shop" i wasted more time placing ui elements than writing common code, hahah :/
Yeah, cause i love everything BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAR! (UI and UX are important)
So, to my surprise, for that app i got 10!
It was a fun journey ;)
